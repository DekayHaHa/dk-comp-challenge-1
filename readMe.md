# Static Comp 1!
- A static comp project from the Front End program at Turing

## Motivation
- This static comp came easier than the last but pushed me to learn about new aspects of css. It was very rewarding as I learned a new techniques and  different approaches to similar features. This helped keep me focused on the ultimate goal of learning. 


## Build status
- Layout complete (Would argue for a centered approach to the cards)


## Tech/framework used
- HTML, CSS, in Sublime
